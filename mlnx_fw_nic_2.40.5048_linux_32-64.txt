2.0  Installation and Setup Instructions
----------------------------------------

  This package should be used with several of IBM's automated update 
  management tools, including UpdateXpress Manager, UpdateXpress System Packs, 
  UpdateXpress System Pack Installer (UXSPi) and ToolsCenter Suite CLI. 

  Please refer to the instructions that came with your specific management
  tool. Installation using these tools generally requires little or no user
  input to complete the installation.

  This package can also be installed as a standalone executable or the files
  can be extracted for a manual installation. Please see section 2.2 for
  standalone installation instructions.

  2.1  Installation Notes

         - This firmware installation package is intended to be used with 
           X-Clarity, UpdateXpress or OneCli.

         - After updating firmware on an adapter, the firmware and driver must 
           be reset to complete the installation.


  2.2  Standalone Installation Instructions

  2.2.1  Using Package Executable to Update Device Firmware

         1) Copy the package executable file to a temporary directory on your
            hard drive.

         2) Run the package as follows:

            /tmp/mlnx_fw_nic_2.40.5048_linux_x86-64.bin -s

  2.2.2  Firmware Update Options

          a) Forced Update:
  
            To force a firmware update, use the -f option:

            /tmp/mlnx_fw_nic_2.40.5048_linux_x86-64.bin -f


            NOTE: These two options can be combined to run a silent, forced update:

            /tmp/mlnx_fw_nic_2.40.5048_linux_x86-64.bin -s -f

 

3.0  Troubleshooting Tips
-------------------------

  3.1  Package Return Codes:

       0   : No errors detected. Successful installation.

       254/255 : No matching image found.
             
             This indicates that the firmware image for the Mellanox adapter 
             is not included in this package.

             NOTE: When using IBM's automated update management tools, if
             ConnectX-3 and ConnectX-4 adapters are installed, this is a false 
             failure message, due to the fact that the ConnectX-4 firmware is 
             intentionally not included in THIS package.


4.0  Unattended Mode
--------------------

  To run this package in unattended mode, use the silent mode and force flag 
  options:

	mlnx_fw_nic_2.40.5048_linux_x86-64.bin -s -f
